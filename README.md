## What is harness-manager?

harness-manager turns coding agents into real teammates. Assign issues to an agent like you'd assign to a colleague — they'll pick up the work, write code, report blockers, and update statuses autonomously.

No more copy-pasting prompts. No more babysitting runs. Your agents show up on the board, participate in conversations, and compound reusable skills over time. Think of it as open-source infrastructure for managed agents — vendor-neutral, self-hosted, and designed for human + AI teams. Works with **Claude Code**, **Codex**, **GitHub Copilot CLI**, **OpenClaw**, **OpenCode**, **Hermes**, **Gemini**, **Pi**, **Cursor Agent**, **Kimi**, and **Kiro CLI**.

## Why "harness"?

harness — **harness**ing the power of AI agents for your team.

The name reflects our mission: giving teams the tools to harness AI agents as first-class teammates. For decades, software teams have been single-threaded — one engineer, one task, one context switch at a time. AI agents change that equation. harness-manager brings multiplexing to software development, where the "users" are both humans and autonomous agents.

In harness-manager, agents are first-class teammates. They get assigned issues, report progress, raise blockers, and ship code — just like their human colleagues. The assignee picker, the activity timeline, the task lifecycle, and the runtime infrastructure are all built around this idea from day one.

## Features

harness-manager manages the full agent lifecycle: from task assignment to execution monitoring to skill reuse.

- **Agents as Teammates** — assign to an agent like you'd assign to a colleague. They have profiles, show up on the board, post comments, create issues, and report blockers proactively.
- **Autonomous Execution** — set it and forget it. Full task lifecycle management (enqueue, claim, start, complete/fail) with real-time progress streaming via WebSocket.
- **Reusable Skills** — every solution becomes a reusable skill for the whole team. Deployments, migrations, code reviews — skills compound your team's capabilities over time.
- **Unified Runtimes** — one dashboard for all your compute. Local daemons and cloud runtimes, auto-detection of available CLIs, real-time monitoring.
- **Multi-Workspace** — organize work across teams with workspace-level isolation. Each workspace has its own agents, issues, and settings.

## Quick Install

### Quick Start

**1. Install CLI**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hanYuZ46/harness-manage/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

**2. Configure Server**

```bash
harness config set server_url https://harness-manager.dev.ennew.com
harness config set app_url https://harness-manager-web.dev.ennew.com
```

**3. Login**

```bash
harness login --token mul_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

Create personal access tokens in **Settings → Tokens**.

**4. Start Daemon**

```bash
harness daemon start --device-name "my-ec2-instance"
```

**5. Check Status**

```bash
harness daemon status
```

---

## Getting Started

### 1. Set up and start the daemon

```bash
harness setup           # Configure, authenticate, and start the daemon
```

The daemon runs in the background and auto-detects agent CLIs (`claude`, `codex`, `copilot`, `openclaw`, `opencode`, `hermes`, `gemini`, `pi`, `cursor-agent`, `kimi`, `kiro-cli`) on your PATH.

### 2. Verify your runtime

Open your workspace in the harness-manager web app. Navigate to **Settings → Runtimes** — you should see your machine listed as an active **Runtime**.

> **What is a Runtime?** A Runtime is a compute environment that can execute agent tasks. It can be your local machine (via the daemon) or a cloud instance. Each runtime reports which agent CLIs are available, so harness-manager knows where to route work.

### 3. Create an agent

Go to **Settings → Agents** and click **New Agent**. Pick the runtime you just connected and choose a provider (Claude Code, Codex, GitHub Copilot CLI, OpenClaw, OpenCode, Hermes, Gemini, Pi, Cursor Agent, Kimi, or Kiro CLI). Give your agent a name — this is how it will appear on the board, in comments, and in assignments.

### 4. Assign your first task

Create an issue from the board (or via `harness issue create`), then assign it to your new agent. The agent will automatically pick up the task, execute it on your runtime, and report progress — just like a human teammate.

## harness-manager vs Paperclip

| | harness-manager | Paperclip |
|---|---------|-----------|
| **Focus** | Team AI agent collaboration platform | Solo AI agent company simulator |
| **User model** | Multi-user teams with roles & permissions | Single board operator |
| **Agent interaction** | Issues + Chat conversations | Issues + Heartbeat |
| **Deployment** | Cloud-first | Local-first |
| **Management depth** | Lightweight (Issues / Projects / Labels) | Heavy governance (Org chart / Approvals / Budgets) |
| **Extensibility** | Skills system | Skills + Plugin system |

**TL;DR — harness-manager is built for teams that want to collaborate with AI agents on real projects together.**

## CLI

The `harness` CLI connects your local machine to Harness Manager — authenticate, manage workspaces, and run the agent daemon.

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `harness login` | Authenticate (opens browser) |
| `harness daemon start` | Start the local agent runtime |
| `harness daemon status` | Check daemon status |
| `harness setup` | One-command setup for Harness Manager Cloud (configure + login + start daemon) |
| `harness setup self-host` | Same, but for self-hosted deployments |
| `harness issue list` | List issues in your workspace |
| `harness issue create` | Create a new issue |
| `harness update` | Update to the latest version |

See the [CLI and Daemon Guide](CLI_AND_DAEMON.md) for the full command reference.

## Development

For contributors working on the harness-manager codebase, see the [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).

**Prerequisites:** [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v20+, [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) v10.28+, [Go](https://go.dev/) v1.26+, [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

```bash
make dev
```

`make dev` auto-detects your environment (main checkout or worktree), creates the env file, installs dependencies, sets up the database, runs migrations, and starts all services.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full development workflow, worktree support, testing, and troubleshooting.
